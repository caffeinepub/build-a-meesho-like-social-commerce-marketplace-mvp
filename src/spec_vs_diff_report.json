  "summary": "Diff implements a new /checkout route with a 3-step CheckoutPage, updates Cart CTA to navigate to checkout, and adds INR currency formatting via a new formatINR utility used across several pages. Backend order model is extended to include an optional address field with a migration. However, backend changes shown do not implement a structured delivery address type nor persistence of the chosen payment option on the order record (both required).",
