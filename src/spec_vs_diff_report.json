  "summary": "Diff implements new accepted/declined order statuses, adds frontend admin order management hooks and UI, and updates buyer OrdersPage to display new statuses. Backend API additions for admin listing and status updates are not visible in the provided backend diff snippet, so their implementation cannot be confirmed from the evidence shown. A new backend migration module was added, which was not explicitly requested.",

      "id": "REQ-29",
      "requirement": "Add an admin-only query API to list all orders and an admin-only update API to transition an order from pending to accepted/declined with clear English errors for: order not found, caller not admin, invalid transition.",
      "reason": "OrderStatus variants were added, but the diff excerpt for backend/main.mo is truncated and does not show any new getAllOrders/updateOrderStatus methods, nor the required authorization and transition validation/error messages.",
