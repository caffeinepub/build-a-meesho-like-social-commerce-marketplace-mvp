  "summary": "Diff adds a new `stock` field to the backend `Product` type and introduces a migration that defaults existing products to stock=100. Frontend adds an admin stock management section and React Query mutation for updating stock, plus client-side stock-limit checks on Product Details and Cart. However, the diff summary does not provide explicit evidence that the backend implements the required admin-only stock update API, non-negative stock validation/error messaging, or the required server-side stock enforcement and stock decrement on checkout; Checkout UI handling for backend stock-limit failures is also not evidenced in the provided truncation.",
  "missing_requirements": [

      "requirement": "Backend must reject negative stock values with a clear English error message, and product read APIs must return stock.",
      "reason": "While `Product` now includes `stock`, the diff summary does not show validation that prevents negative stock (e.g., in add/edit/update stock paths) nor does it explicitly show the product read API implementations returning the new field.",
